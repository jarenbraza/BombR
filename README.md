# BombR
BombR is a Bomberman-clone made from ASP.NET Core and SignalR.

## How It Works
SignalR provides real-time web functionality for lobby, game, and chat functionalities. The game state is passed across client and server for every meaningful update.

## Motivation
This is mainly for getting used to C# again. It's a fun recreation of a past project made during in college.
